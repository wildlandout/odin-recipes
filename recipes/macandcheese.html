        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is absolutely nothing I love more than cheese. And when you add pasta to it? Fuggetaboutit.
            Mac and cheese is one of those recipes that can take on so many different forms. I love it anyway I can get it but baked mac and cheese is my very favorite and I'll tell you why... The topping. I use breadcrumbs for my topping occasionally, but, a Panko topped mac and cheese is just that much better.
            I mix in Parmesan, butter, and paprika with the Panko so it crisps up beautifully and gets a nice golden brown color when this amazing homemade mac and cheese is baked.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz elbow macaroni, cooked <em>(or other tubular pasta)</em></li>

            <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
